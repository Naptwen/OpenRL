# Install
- Download the usg_AI.exe file (NSIS file).\
- Or download the 7Z file.

# usgAI v2.2.0 --alpha 
It is integration program for machine learning

# GUI version
```double click the exe file```
On the way by using OpenGL, OpenCV (Linux, Window), Metal (apple) and OpenGLES(Android)

# CLI version
```using terminal run the file```
1. This is machine learning program tool
2. This includes editor for creating basic strucutre for neural network, CNN, RL model, Enviroment rule.
3. Base on created file, you can run the reinforcement machine learning.\
4. You can run the multi threading and also GPGPU (opencl) together
Fo any question please leave message in discussion page.
5. Add base64 decoding encoding and reduce the save file size for speed up the loading bigfile of neural network
6. Update and Fix for OpenCL algorithm now speed is increase dramatically.\
One hot run example\
